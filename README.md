# Demo Code for Variational Expectation-Maximization Paper

Code I wrote that replicates the examples done in [Tzikas et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4644060)

### Prerequisites/Installation

These are jupyter notebook files. Simply install the dependencies shown in `requirements.txt` with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt         # I have a preference for the --user flag as well
```

and you should be good to go!
